Hi, I'm not proud of this project to be on my account, so please let me happy when you are refactoring this :(

# TODO:
* Apply `MVVM` pattern
* Use `Dagger` and `Retrofit` 
* Use `RxJava 2` if you need it
* Refactor Kotlin code (Follow the guideline of kotlin)
* Use `ConstraintLayout` 
* Do Whatever you want on this project, be proud when you share this project with your colleague :)
